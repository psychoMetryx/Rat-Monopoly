# Rat Monopoly Rulebook

## 1. Overview
Rat Monopoly is a lethal, three-board parody of Monopoly where theology, organized crime, and gambling collide. Players race to accumulate indulgences, hoard rubbies, or simply outlive everyone else while dodging hell, the rat mob, and a volatile lotto pot.

### Win Conditions (any one)
- Hold **three indulgence cards**.
- Reach **3000 rubbies** in liquid cash.
- Be the **last living player**.

## 2. Components
- **Boards (3 total):**
  - **Surface Board:** Core loop with GO, church, tax office, properties, “take a shit” cards, drug den, hell square, and more.
  - **Subsurface Sewer Board:** Vertical track with special moves (e.g., Venga Bus, teleports). Exiting drops you onto GO as if you landed there.
  - **Feces/Poop/Subsewer-Adjacent Board:** Extra properties and odd effect spaces.
- **Currency:** Rubbies (RB). Table slang: rubby = 1, rub = 10, job = 100, jobby ≈ 500, workforce = 1000 (10 jobs).
- **Starting Cash:** 800 rubbies on a “big wank” debit card per player.
- **Cards and Tokens:**
  - Property deeds.
  - **Take a Shit** cards (chance-style events; can grant rat mob cards, STDs, movement, etc.).
  - **Rat Mob** cards (mark mafia debt; risk of instant death on future drug den/rat crime alley landings).
  - **Indulgence** cards (get-out-of-hell-free; three indulgences auto-win).
  - **Job** token/state (tracks employment).
  - **Death Squad** tokens (flavor markers for failed hell rolls).
  - **Ferry/Fairy** tickets (one-shot teleports between boards, often to/from subsewer for GO lotto access).

## 3. Setup
1. Place all three boards and align teleports/entry squares.
2. Shuffle the Take a Shit deck and place it on the surface board.
3. Give each player 800 rubbies and a token.
4. Place all indulgence, rat mob, and property deed cards in their areas.
5. Start the rat lotto pot at 0 rubbies.
6. Determine starting player by die roll.

## 4. Turn Structure

### If you are **not** in hell
1. **Pre-move (optional):**
   - Use a ferry/fairy ticket to enter or exit the subsurface sewer.
   - Use the rat fairy or similar cards to move to specified squares (e.g., piss playground) before rolling.
2. **Roll:** Usually 1d6 on the surface board; the subsurface sewer can require 2d6 variants depending on square rules.
3. **Move:** Advance your piece the rolled number of spaces on your current board.
4. **Resolve the space:**
   - Buy/auction properties.
   - Pay rent, tax, or church dues.
   - Draw a Take a Shit card or Rat Mob card if instructed.
   - Get a job, go to hell, enter the subsurface sewer, visit the drug den, etc.
5. **After-effects:** Apply lingering states (job protection, rat mob risk, indulgences, ferry tickets, card effects).

### If you **are** in hell
- You do not move normally. Instead, you attempt to escape (see Section 5.3).

## 5. Spaces & Mechanics

### 5.1 Properties & Rent
- Landing on an **unowned property** lets you buy it (costs are high relative to starting cash, e.g., 360–400 RB).
- Landing on an **owned property** requires paying rent. Owning full sets or special spaces can increase rent.
- **Tax Office:** If someone lands on your tax office, they pay **rent ×4**, which is punishing but risky because owners often land on their own expensive combos.

### 5.2 Church & Indulgences
- Landing on **Church** usually requires a payment to the church.
- You may **buy indulgence cards** there (often 300–500 RB). Effects:
  - Act as **get-out-of-hell-free** cards (spend to avoid hell or to escape without rolling).
  - Collect **three indulgences** to **win instantly**.
- Certain combos (e.g., owning the tax office) can multiply church payments, typically harming the payer.

### 5.3 Hell (Jail, but lethal)
**Going to Hell:**
- Landing on the hell square and refusing/failing to buy an indulgence.
- Certain cards or spaces that explicitly send you there.

**Escaping Hell:**
- First attempt: roll a **6** to leave.
- Second attempt: roll a **5 or 6** to leave.
- Third attempt: roll a **4, 5, or 6** to leave.
- Each failed attempt grants a **Death Squad** token (flavor only).
- If all three attempts fail, face the **firing squad**:
  - Flip a coin and call it.
  - Correct call → you live and leave hell.
  - Wrong call → you **die** and are removed from the game.

**Consequences of Hell:**
- Entering hell causes you to **lose your job** status.
- Death resets your assets (see Section 6).

### 5.4 Jobs
- Landing on **JOB** immediately gives **100 rubbies** and marks you as **employed**.
- While employed:
  - You **do not pay rent**.
  - You **cannot directly buy properties**.
  - You **must still pay church and tax** obligations.
- Job status ends when you **pass GO** or **enter hell**.

### 5.5 Rat Mob & Drug Den
- Landing on **Drug Den** or **Rat Crime Alley** typically forces a **Rat Mob card** draw.
- While holding a Rat Mob card:
  - Landing on those spaces again means you get **shot by the rat mafia and die**.
  - You may pay **500 rubbies** to clear the debt and discard the card, avoiding death.

### 5.6 Rat Lotto & GO
- When you **land on GO** (not merely pass):
  - Option A: take **200 rubbies**.
  - Option B: **Gamble** the 200 into the **rat lotto pot** and **call a die result (1–6)**.
  - Roll a die:
    - If it matches your call, you **win the entire pot** immediately.
    - If not, your 200 stays in the pot; play continues.
- The **rat lotto pot** also grows whenever a player **dies or goes bankrupt** (their cash is added).
- Because **3000 rubbies** is a win condition, late-game lotto wins can instantly end the game.

### 5.7 Subsurface Sewer Board
- Certain squares or cards send you to the **subsurface sewer** side board.
- Movement there may use special rules (often **2d6**, pick outcomes per square text).
- **Exiting the subsewer** places you on **GO as if you landed there**, guaranteeing a lotto opportunity under normal GO rules.

## 6. Death & Bankruptcy
- When a player **dies** (rat mob, hell firing squad, etc.) or **goes bankrupt**:
  - **Properties** return to the **unowned** pool.
  - All **cash** moves directly into the **rat lotto pot**.
  - **Indulgences** are discarded.
- The board reopens, making mid/late game volatile and lotto-focused.

## 7. Win Conditions
- **Three indulgences**, **3000 rubbies** cash, **or last living player** all end the game immediately in favor of the achiever.

## 8. How It Feels To Play
- Property scarcity makes early game highly luck-driven for ownership.
- Jobs, church, and tax office twist money flow; rent immunity collides with unavoidable tithes and taxes.
- Rat mob threats and hell make elimination common, turning the game into a battle royale.
- Typical arc: several deaths → huge lotto pot → a single GO gamble hits → instant cash-win.
- It’s Monopoly plus theology, organized crime, and gambling, squeezed into three cramped boards.
